# Refactoring Summary

## Completed Work ‚úÖ

### 1. Removed Unused Code
- **Deleted**: `src/entities/LightningProjectile.js`
- **Removed** 7 unwanted weapons from weaponTypes.js
- **Removed** unused imports: `DynamiteProjectile`, `OrbitProjectile`, `ElectricFieldEffect`

### 2. Created Effect System

New directory structure:
```
src/effects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BaseEffect.js         - Base class for all effects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LightningEffect.js    - Configurable lightning bolts with branches
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SpreadEffect.js       - Spread pattern effects (shotgun-style)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FireEffect.js         - Fire explosions
```

**Benefits:**
- Effects are now reusable and configurable
- Separation of visual effects from gameplay logic
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Consistent API across all effects

### 3. Refactored 4 Weapons to Use Effect System

#### Thunder Strike (FROST_SHOT)
- **Before**: ~130 lines of inline effect creation
- **After**: ~70 lines using LightningEffect
- **Improvement**: 46% code reduction

#### Static Burst (SHOTGUN)
- Uses `SpreadEffect` for multi-bolt spread pattern
- Cleaner separation of visuals and damage logic

#### Power Chord (RIFLE)
- Uses `LightningEffect` with custom configuration
- Simple red beam effect

#### Pyro Explosion (DYNAMITE)
- Uses `FireEffect` wrapper
- Simplified weapon code

**Remaining weapons** (kept as-is, use projectile systems):
- Chain Lightning (LIGHTNING) - uses ColoredLightning
- Fireball (FIRE_LANCE) - uses FlameProjectile

### 4. Created Audio System

New directory structure:
```
src/audio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SoundCache.js         - Handles loading and caching audio files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProceduralSounds.js   - All procedural sound generation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SoundScheduler.js     - Timing and scheduling system
```

**SoundSystem improvements:**
- **Extracted procedural sounds** - All oscillator/noise-based sounds moved to ProceduralSounds class
- **Added timing/scheduling** - SoundScheduler handles delays and rate limiting
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents sound spam (e.g., max 20 shoots/sec, 33 hits/sec)
- **Scheduled playback** - All play methods now accept optional delay parameter
- **Better architecture** - SoundSystem now acts as coordinator, delegating to specialized modules
- **SoundCache** - Efficient audio loading with automatic caching and preloading
- **Maintained backward compatibility** - All existing playSound() methods still work

### 5. Enhanced Lightning Effect System

**Recursive Branch Spawning:**
- Branches now recursively call spawn() method for consistent jagged appearance
- Added depth parameter to control recursion levels
- Added maxDepth config parameter (default: 1) to prevent infinite recursion
- Branch width progressively thins with each recursion level
- Branch endpoints collected recursively for damage calculation

**Benefits:**
- Lightning branches now have same detailed, jagged appearance as main bolt
- More realistic and visually appealing lightning strikes
- Configurable depth allows for more complex branching patterns

### 6. Fixed FlameProjectile Visibility

**Issues resolved:**
- FlameProjectile sprites were not visible during gameplay
- Pierce count logic was incorrect (>=  should be >)

**Fixes applied:**
- Added initial mesh position in Projectile constructor
- Increased flame sprite scale from 0.8 to 1.2 for better visibility
- Increased flame trail particle scale from 0.5 to 0.8
- Added `depthWrite: false` to prevent depth buffer conflicts
- Set `renderOrder` to ensure flames render on top of other objects
- Fixed pierce count comparison to match base Projectile class

### 7. Enhanced Lightning Visual Effects

**Light Blue Glow Added:**
- All lightning bolts now have a third outer glow layer with light blue color (0x88ddff)
- Outer glow is 2.5x the width of the main bolt
- Creates a more dramatic and visible lightning effect
- Glow fades out with the bolt for smooth animation

**Thunder Strike Ground Explosion:**
- Created new `LightningExplosion` entity for devastating ground impacts
- 16 radial lightning bolts emanate from impact point
- 40 electric particles with blue/white gradient colors
- Expanding shockwave rings (3 staggered rings) showing area of effect
- Electric blue color (0x88ddff), linewidth 8, opacity 0.5
- Explosion radius: 5 units
- Base damage increased to 200 (instant kill for most mobs)
- Removed old ground sparks in favor of unified explosion effect
- Removed inline damage calculation from Thunder Strike weapon

**Pyro Explosion Enhanced:**
- Replaced static scorch circle with expanding shockwave rings
- 3 staggered rings expand from center to show area of effect
- Orange-red color (0xff4400), linewidth 8, opacity 0.5
- Rings fade out as they expand for smooth visual effect
- Consistent visual language with Thunder Strike explosion

## Testing Status

‚úÖ Dev server running without errors
‚è≥ Needs manual gameplay testing

### 8. Particle System Implementation

**Custom particle system now implemented and integrated!**

**Architecture implemented:**
```
src/particles/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ParticleSystem.js    - Main system manager with object pooling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Particle.js          - Individual particle class
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ParticleEmitter.js   - Configuration-based spawner
```

**ParticleSystem features:**
- Object pooling (100 particle pool by default)
- Automatic sprite visibility management
- Particle lifecycle tracking
- Pool exhaustion warnings
- Update only active particles
- Memory efficient reuse

**Particle features:**
- Position, velocity, acceleration physics
- Scale interpolation (start ‚Üí end)
- Opacity interpolation (start ‚Üí end)
- Automatic expiration based on lifetime
- Reset method for pooling

**ParticleEmitter features:**
- Configuration-based spawning
- Burst pattern (radial from center)
- Cone pattern (directional spray)
- Gradient texture creation helper
- Random value ranges for variety
- Material/texture support

**Integration:**
- Integrated into GameEngine (engine.particles)
- Updates automatically in game loop
- Available to all entities and effects
- Zero-copy access from anywhere in game

**Ready to use** - Existing particle code (FireExplosion, LightningExplosion) can now be refactored to use this system

### 9. Ice Spell Freeze Effect

**Implemented freeze/slow mechanic for ice spells:**

**Enemy Freeze State:**
- Enemies hit by Ice Lance are frozen for 10 seconds
- Frozen enemies move at 20% normal speed (80% slower)
- Freeze timer automatically decreases and restores normal speed when expired

**Visual Feedback:**
- Frozen enemies display a pulsing cyan glow (0x88ccff to 0x50a0ff gradient)
- Glow opacity pulses between 0.3-0.7 for clear visual indication
- Glow automatically removed when freeze expires
- Glow scale adapts to enemy size (1.8x mesh scale)

**Implementation:**
- Added `applyFreeze(duration)` method to Enemy class
- Freeze effect applied on Ice Lance hit (only if enemy doesn't die)
- Freeze state tracked with `isFrozen`, `freezeTimer`, and `freezeGlow` properties
- Speed management uses `baseSpeed` for restoration after freeze

**Benefits:**
- Clear tactical advantage for ice spells
- Visual clarity for frozen state
- Smooth speed transition (no sudden jumps)
- Resource cleanup (glow removed and disposed properly)

### 10. Fixed Player Self-Damage

**Fixed bug where player's own spells damaged the player:**

**Issue:**
- All spell projectiles and explosions were damaging the player
- Collision detection only checked for `entity.health` without excluding player

**Fix:**
- Added player exclusion check to all spell entities: `if (entity === this.engine.game?.player) return;`
- Applied to all projectiles and explosions:
  - FlameProjectile (Fireball)
  - IceLance
  - MagicBullet
  - FireExplosion (Pyro Explosion)
  - LightningExplosion (Thunder Strike)
  - RingOfFire

**Result:**
- Player is now immune to their own spells
- Only enemies take damage from player spells

### 11. Ring of Ice Spell + Ring Burst Mechanic

**New Ice Spell: Ring of Ice**

Created a new ice variant of Ring of Fire with freeze mechanics:
- 64 cyan/blue ice particles orbiting player
- Lower damage (5% per particle vs 9% for fire)
- Applies freeze effect on hit (10 seconds, 80% slow)
- Same regeneration speed as fire (0.1s normally, 0.01s after burst)
- Ice colors: white-cyan to deep blue gradient

**Ring Burst Mechanic**

Added burst mode to both Ring of Fire and Ring of Ice:

**Trigger Methods:**
- Press [R] key
- Click UI button (bottom right corner)

**UI Button Features:**
- Only appears when player has Ring of Fire or Ring of Ice equipped
- Circular button (80px) at bottom right of screen
- Changes color based on ring type:
  - Fire: Orange/red gradient (radial-gradient #ff8800 to #ff4400)
  - Ice: Cyan gradient (radial-gradient #88ddff to #4499ff)
- Lights up with golden border and pulsing glow when ring is full
- Disabled (grayed out) when ring not full or on cooldown
- Shows "[R] Burst" label below button
- Smooth hover animation (scale 1.1x)

**Burst Behavior:**
- Can trigger when ring is 50% full or more (not just 100%)
- Shoots all active particles outward in radial pattern
- Fire burst: 6x damage per projectile
- Ice burst: 5x damage per projectile + freeze effect
- Projectiles travel at 15 units/sec for 2 seconds
- 1.5 second cooldown before ring can regenerate (very fast)
- All particles deactivated during burst
- Ring stays disabled until cooldown completes
- After burst, ring regenerates at 10x speed (0.01s per particle) until >90% full, then normal speed (0.1s)

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `isRingFull()` method to check if 50% or more particles are active
- Added `triggerBurst()` method to convert particles to projectiles
- Burst projectiles stored separately from ring particles
- Burst projectiles handle their own collision detection
- Cooldown timer (`burstCooldownTimer`) prevents regeneration
- Sprites kept visible during burst, hidden when inactive and not in burst

**Files Created:**
- `src/entities/RingOfIce.js` - New ice ring spell

**Files Modified:**
- `src/entities/RingOfFire.js` - Added burst mechanic
- `src/entities/RingOfIce.js` - Added burst mechanic
- `src/spells/spellTypes.js` - Added RING_OF_ICE spell
- `src/components/DustAndDynamite.jsx` - Added burst button UI and keyboard handler

## Optional Future Enhancements

### Particle System Refactoring (Optional)
The particle system is implemented and ready, but existing explosion effects still use manual particle management. Optionally refactor:
- FireExplosion to use ParticleEmitter
- LightningExplosion to use ParticleEmitter
- FlameProjectile trail to use ParticleSystem

**Note:** This refactoring is optional - current implementations work fine. The particle system is available for new effects.

## Architecture Benefits

The new architecture provides:
- **Modularity**: Effects, audio, and gameplay logic are separated
- **Reusability**: Effects can be used across multiple weapons
- **Configurability**: Easy to tweak effect parameters via constructor
- **Maintainability**: 46% less code in weapons, clearer structure
- **Performance**: Better audio caching, reduced redundancy
- **Consistency**: All effects follow same API pattern
