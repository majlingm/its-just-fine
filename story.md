Opening — The Adult
I had a dream, about a dream I once had as a child.
And in that dream I…
I called something more, more of myself.
Time draped like armor,
and I walked into the place I had left behind.

Fragment I — The Path (Adult)
Stones know my steps.
Shadows gather as if they remember me.
The air tastes of what once was,
yet still I move deeper
into what calls.

Fragment II — The Child
The dark runs faster than I do.
It bites when I stumble,
wraps around my arms when I rise.
Time slides from me like water.
But I follow the dream—
the one that shows me tomorrow,
the one the shadows want to take.

Fragment III — The Struggle (Adult)
I see me, small against the tide.
Our eyes find each other.
The darkness knows me. I know it.
I spread my arms wide.
Come then, I am here.
Its weight pours in,
so he may remain untouched.

Fragment IV — The Transfer (Child)
The darkness bends away from me,
drawn into him.
I can breathe.
His shape cracks,
but his gaze does not.

Fragment V — The Bearing (Adult)
I gather it and carry it forward.
The door of the dream unseals—
morning like a blade.
I rise bearing what once left me,
taking the darkness into day
so he may wake in light.

Epilogue — The Boy's Voice
I opened my eyes.
I lived where I should not have lived.
I grew.
I aged.
I forgot.

Epilogue — The Adult's Voice
Until years bent my bones.
Until my sleep grew deep.
Until one day
I dreamed a dream I once had as a child.
